# **P-FHDI**

Parallel fractional hot-deck imputation (P-FHDI) is a general-purpose, assumption-free tool for handling item nonresponse in big incomplete data by combining the theory of FHDI and parallel computing. It inherits all the strengths of the _R_ Package FHDI. P-FHDI can tackle big incomplete data with up to millions of instances or 10,000 variables.

# Usage

## Dependencies

- Intel MPI
- Access to HPC Facilities


## Command
P-FHDI has been broadly validated on Condo2017, a free high-performance computing (HPC) facility open to iowa state university faculties. Users can run the following commands to deploy P-FHDI on Condo2017. 

Load the Intel compiler:
```linux
module load intel/18.3
```

Compile P-FHDI program:
```linux
mpiicc â€“o main_MPI main_MPI.cpp
```

Submit a job script to launch MPI code with requested computing resources
```linux
sbatch run.sbatch
```
Note that users should carefully investigate how to deploy P-FHDI on other HPC facilities!
